To send serial data via the Bluetooth connection, we will use a protocol called rfcomm. This allows us to create a virtual serial port over the Bluetooth connection. The instructions here assume you have already established a bluetooth conenction with the Raspberry Pi.








Setup:

On the Raspberry Pi, you will need to add the following lines to the file: /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service

ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -C
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/sdptool add SP

Otherwise you may run into an issue where no serial data is received.





Before doing the rest of the steps, the Pi should be connected to your computer via Bluetooth.

Now, on the Raspberry Pi:

Enter the following command into the terminal:

sudo rfcomm watch 0

This will make the Pi wait for an incoming connection. When a connection is made, the virtual serial port will be created at /dev/rfcomm0. This can be changed by replacing "0" with another number (e.g. using "5" instead will create the serial connection at /dev/rfcomm5). When the connection closes, the Pi will start looking for a connection again. This way you can disconnect and reconnect without doing anything from the Pi.








The steps to connect from your computer will depend on your OS.

On Windows:

Open control panel. From there, select "devices and printers." Find the Raspberry Pi and right click it, then select "properties." In the properties window, find the "Serial Port Protocol" entry under "services," and note the port it is using (it will look something like "COM3"). Make note of this port. This is the port you will use for reading/writing information. You do not need to enter any commands to initiate the connection under Windows. The computer will automatically open the connection when you access the serial port from your program.

On Linux:

Enter the following command into the terminal:

sudo rfcomm connect 0 [bdaddress]

where [bdaddress] is the pi's address.

As with on the pi, the connection will now be made at /dev/rfcomm0. This is the port you will use for reading/writing information. You will need to repeat this process everytime you wish to connect the serial port.

Instructions for MacOS will be added later.




Once this connection is established, you can now read/write to the port that you set up as you would any other serial connection.
