To create the bluetooth connection for the first time, follow these steps.

Before we start, you should figure out what the bluetooth address of both devices are. This will be helpful. On the Pi, you can do this by running "hciconfig -a".

Make sure your computer is "discoverable" via bluetooth. This usually just involves opening the bluetooth section of your settings. Look it up for your particular OS and device.

Using the command line on the Raspberry Pi, do the following:

Type "bluetoothctl"
A prompt that says "[bluetooth]#" should appear.

Into this prompt, enter these commands:
discoverable on
pairable on
agent on
default-agent

After this, return to the bluetooth settings on your computer. You should see the Rapspberry Pi in the lsit of available devices. Connect to it.

You may be prompted to enter a pin. Pick a pin of your choice and enter it on both devices.

Finally, on the bluetooth prompt on the Pi, type:
trust [bluetooth address]
where [bluetooth address] is the address of the computer.

This will allow you to connect from the computer in the future without having to enter anything into the Raspberry Pi prompt.
